            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Our Services may involve interactions with third-party workspace providers, property owners, or service vendors. EverySpaces is not a party to any agreement you enter into with third parties and is not responsible for their actions, services, or policies.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-serif mb-2">8.1 Our Fee Structure</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
              EverySpaces charges a <strong>one-time brokerage fee equivalent to one (1) month's rent</strong> of the rented office space. This fee is payable upon successful completion of the workspace deal — i.e., when the lease or rental agreement is signed between the client and the property owner/provider.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-serif mb-2">8.2 When Payment Is Due</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The brokerage fee becomes due immediately upon signing of the lease/rental agreement. Payment must be completed within <strong>7 business days</strong> of the agreement date unless otherwise agreed in writing.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-serif mb-2">8.3 Accepted Payment Methods</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4 space-y-1">
              <li><strong>Bank Transfer (NEFT/RTGS/IMPS):</strong> Direct transfer to EverySpaces' designated bank account</li>
              <li><strong>UPI:</strong> Payment via Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, or any UPI-enabled app</li>
              <li><strong>Cheque:</strong> Demand draft or account payee cheque in favour of EverySpaces</li>
              <li><strong>Online Payment:</strong> Via payment link shared by EverySpaces (credit/debit card supported)</li>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-serif mb-2">8.4 Invoicing & GST</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
              A proper tax invoice including applicable GST will be issued for all service fees. Clients are responsible for any additional taxes or charges imposed by regulatory authorities.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-serif mb-2">8.5 Refund Policy</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The brokerage fee is <strong>non-refundable</strong> once the lease/rental agreement has been signed. If a deal falls through before signing due to reasons attributable to EverySpaces, a full refund of any advance payment will be provided. EverySpaces reserves the right to modify its fee structure with reasonable prior notice for future engagements.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-serif mb-4">9. Confidentiality</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Both parties agree to maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary or sensitive information shared during the course of our engagement. This includes business strategies, financial details, workspace requirements, and any other information marked or reasonably understood as confidential. This obligation survives termination of the engagement.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-serif mb-4">10. Indemnification</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless EverySpaces and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the Services, violation of these Terms, or infringement of any third-party rights.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-serif mb-4">11. Termination</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              EverySpaces reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time, with or without cause, and without prior notice. Upon termination, all provisions of these Terms that should reasonably survive — including intellectual property, limitation of liability, indemnification, and governing law — shall remain in effect.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-serif mb-4">12. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              These Terms are governed by the laws of India. Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of the Services shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. Both parties agree to attempt resolution through good-faith negotiation before pursuing legal action.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-serif mb-4">13. Force Majeure</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-6">
              EverySpaces shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performing our obligations due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters, pandemics, government actions, cyber attacks, or infrastructure failures.
            </p>
